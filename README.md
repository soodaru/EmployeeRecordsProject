#EmployeeRecordsProject

The goal of this project was to create a JavaFX GUI that contains pre-generated Employee Records
The program would have the ability for: 
 - Basic Navigation: look through all the pre-existing Employees in the Navigation Window
 - Record Modification: edit the records of the employees that were already part of the Employee.dat file, add or remove employees
 - Record Search: Look up the employee records based on the specified categories (Employee ID, Name, City or Position)
